## Employee Management System (EMS)

Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS) project! This repository contains the full-stack code for EMS, a web-based solution that helps organizations manage employee records, leave requests, and administrative tasks efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview

EMS is a scalable, secure, and user-friendly application designed to replace manual HR management processes with an automated system. The application is developed using .NET (C#) for backend, SQL Server for database management, and a modern JavaScript framework (React/Angular/Vue) for the frontend.

The system is designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with essential HR operations like employee CRUD, leave management, authentication, and dashboards.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

.NET Framework (C#) – Backend logic & REST API

SQL Server – Relational database management

Entity Framework – ORM for database operations

JavaScript (React/Angular/Vue) – Frontend interface

HTML5 & CSS3 – Structure & styling

Bootstrap / Responsive Design – Mobile-first UI

Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration

Visual Studio – Development environment

## 📌 Features

✅ Secure Login & Authentication (Role-based Access Control)

✅ Employee CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

✅ Leave Management (Apply, Approve, Reject)

✅ Administrative Dashboard with search & filter

✅ Responsive UI for desktop & mobile

✅ Data integrity and security following OWASP guidelines
