# Employee Management System (EMS)
Welcome to the  **Employee Management System (EMS)** project! This repository contains the full-stack code for EMS, a web-based solution that helps organizations manage employee records, leave requests, and administrative tasks efficiently.

## **ðŸš€ Project Overview**
EMS is a **scalable, secure, and user-friendly application** designed to replace manual HR management processes with an automated system.
